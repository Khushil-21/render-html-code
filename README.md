This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

currently whta is on / route will be now transfered to /renderer
and / route will be home page where we see local storage and has one btn to navigate to renderer page 

with remove new lines button i want to add 2 more buttons 
- Save code : which opens a popup and ask user a name and with that name saves the code in the localstorage 
- View codes : redirect to / route where we can see all codes from local storage with all CRUD opreqations and also there will be button in all code "see in editor" then it will redirect to /renderer/{{slug}} with this dynamic slug it will render every code from local storrage 
and if slug is not presenet then its basic editor where user can paste their code similar to what we have currently
